Sooo, here's a tiny fun project I've been working on casually.
I recently discovered the m5stick, a nice little device based on the esp32 board.
It has plenty of features and is quite cheap, great for DIYing IoT projects and such.
One day I realised the exposed gpio fit a rotary encoder nicely, so decided to make a few games based on that.
I have no experience in C/C++, and I'm a bit of a messy coder, I just wanted to make some games :p
